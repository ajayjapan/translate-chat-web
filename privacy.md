<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p>Last Updated: October 24, 2023.</p>
<p>TranslateChat is a messaging service designed to translate all the messages
you send. As a consequence, it currently does not employ end-to-end
encryption. Please be aware that all your messages are shared with
TranslateChat and our Large Language Model ("LLM") provider to facilitate the
translation process.</p>
<p>At TranslateChat, one of our main priorities is the privacy of our users. Our
Privacy Policy ("Privacy Policy") helps explain our data practices, including
the types of information collected and how we handle the information obtained
when you use our Services and the information we process to provide our
Services.</p>
<p>For example, our Privacy Policy talks about what information we collect and
how this affects you. It also explains the steps we take to protect your
privacy, like building our Services so delivered messages aren't stored by us
and giving you control over who you communicate with on our Services.</p>
<p>This Privacy Policy applies to all of our Services unless specified otherwise.</p>
<p>Please also read TranslateChat's Terms of Service ("Terms"), which describe
the terms under which you use and we provide our Services.</p>
<p>If you have additional questions or require more information about our Privacy
Policy, do not hesitate to contact us or visit our FAQ page.</p>
<h2>Key Points</h2>
<ul>
<li>Minimum Age: You must be 13+ to use our service.</li>
<li>Message Security: We store delivered messages on your device.</li>
<li>Undelivered Messages: Temporarily kept on our servers, then deleted after delivery.</li>
<li>No end-to-end encryption: Avoid discussing sensitive topics or sharing personal info.</li>
<li>OpenAI: We use OpenAI's technology for message translation.</li>
<li>Translation Accuracy: We do not make any guarantees on accuracy and are not responsible for any inaccuracies.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Information We May Collect</h2>
<p>TranslateChat must receive or collect some information to operate, provide,
improve, understand, customize, support, and market our Services, including
when you install, access, or use our Services.</p>
<p>We obtain a variety of information from and about you as you use the Services.
We need certain information so that we can provide certain Services to you. If
you do not provide us with certain information, or ask us to delete it, we may
no longer be able to provide you with our Services. For example, you must
provide your mobile phone number to create an account to use our Services.</p>
<p>The types of information we receive and collect depend on how you use our
Services.</p>
<p>Our Services have optional features which, if used by you, require us to
collect additional information to provide such features. You will be notified
of such collection, as appropriate. If you choose not to provide the
information needed to use a feature, you will be unable to use the feature.</p>
<h2>Our Advertising Partners</h2>
<p>Some of the advertisers in our app may use cookies and web beacons. Our
advertising partners are listed below. Each of our advertising partners has
their own Privacy Policy for their policies on user data. For easier access,
we hyperlinked to their Privacy Policies below.</p>
<ul>
<li>Google: https://policies.google.com/technologies/ads</li>
</ul>
<h2>Privacy Policies</h2>
<p>You may consult this list to find the Privacy Policy for each of the
advertising partners of TranslateChat.</p>
<p>Third party ad servers or ad networks uses technologies like cookies,
JavaScript, or Beacons that are used in their respective advertisements and
links that appear on TranslateChat. They automatically receive your IP address
when this occurs. These technologies are used to measure the effectiveness of
their advertising campaigns and/or to personalize the advertising content that
you see on this app or other apps or websites.</p>
<p>Note that TranslateChat has no access to or control over these cookies that
are used by third party advertisers.</p>
<h2>Third Party Privacy Policies</h2>
<p>TranslateChat's Privacy Policy does not apply to other advertisers or
websites. Thus, we are advising you to consult the respective Privacy Policies
of these third party ad servers for more detailed information. It may include
their practices and instructions about how to opt-out of certain options.</p>
<h2>Children's Information</h2>
<p>Another part of our priority is adding protection for children while using the
internet. We encourage parents and guardians to observe, participate in,
and/or monitor and guide their online activity.</p>
<p>TranslateChat does not knowingly collect any Personal Identifiable Information
from children under the age of 13. If you think that your child provided this
kind of information on our App, we strongly encourage you to contact us
immediately and we will do our best efforts to promptly remove such
information from our records.</p>
<h2>Online Privacy Policy Only</h2>
<p>This Privacy Policy applies only to our online activities and is valid for
users of our App with regards to the information that they shared and/or
collect in TranslateChat. This policy is not applicable to any information
collected offline or via channels other than this app. Our Privacy Policy was
created with the help of the App Privacy Policy Generator from App-Privacy-
Policy.com</p>
<h2>Consent</h2>
<p>By using our app, you hereby consent to our Privacy Policy and agree to its
Terms and Conditions.</p>
<h2>Information You Provide</h2>
<p>We collect information directly from you through your use of our Services. For
example, we collect information from you through:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your Account Information: This includes your required profile name, primary language, and mobile phone number. To create a TranslateChat account, you must provide these mandatory details. If you don't provide us with this information, you will not be able to create an account to use our Services. You can also choose to add an optional public profile image to your account.</li>
<li>Your Communications with Us: Including user support, in-app feedback submissions, and messages you send to TranslateChat.</li>
<li>Your Messages: We do not retain your messages in the ordinary course of providing our Services to you. Instead, your messages are stored on your device and not typically stored on our servers. Once your messages are delivered, they are deleted from our servers.</li>
<li>Undelivered Messages: If a message cannot be delivered immediately (for example, if the recipient is offline), we keep it in encrypted form on our servers for up to 30 days as we try to deliver it. If a message is still undelivered after 30 days, we delete it.</li>
<li>Message Encryption: Our encryption is currently NOT end-to-end. A copy of the message will be shared with TranslateChat and our LLM provider for translation purposes. Messages are anonymized before being shared with our LLM provider. Our LLM provider may retain anonymized messages for a period of 30 days in order to identify abuse. Don't share sensitive or confidential information in your messages.</li>
<li>Your Contacts (Optional): You can use the contact upload feature and provide us, if permitted by applicable laws, with the phone numbers in your address book, including those of users of our Services and your other contacts. If you grant us access to your address book, we DO NOT upload the entirety of it; only the contacts you choose to initiate a conversation with are sent to our server. Those contact phone numbers are stored on our server in a cryptographically hashed form without any identifying information, such as the name of the contact. They will never be used for any purpose other than to help you find your friends on TranslateChat. We value your privacy and adhere to local laws regarding data protection and privacy.</li>
<li>Your Groups: You can create, join, or be added to groups, and such groups get associated with your account. If you create a group, you provide us with a group name and image or emoji. Group metadata including the list of members is currently stored on our servers in plaintext, so do not put anything private or sensitive in it.</li>
<li>Translation Feedback: When you submit translation feedback, we collect your suggested translation, the initial translation, the content of the original message, and, if applicable, the content of the message it was in response to.</li>
<li>Your Settings: Any settings that you may change through the service, such as muting a group or thread, blocking a user, etc.</li>
<li>Transactions And Payments Data: If you use our payments services, or use our Services meant for purchases or other financial transactions, we process additional information about you, including payment account and transaction information. Payment account and transaction information includes information needed to complete the transaction (for example, information about your payment method, shipping details and transaction amount). If you use our payments services available in your country or territory, our privacy practices are described in the applicable payments privacy policy.</li>
<li>Customer Support And Other Communications: When you contact us for customer support or otherwise communicate with us, you may provide us with information related to your use of our Services, including copies of your messages, any other information you deem helpful, and how to contact you (e.g., an email address). For example, you may send us an email with information relating to app performance or other issues.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Third Party Information</h2>
<ul>
<li>Service Providers: To operate, provide, enhance, understand, customize, support, and market our Services, we collaborate with third party service providers. In specific situations, these companies may share information about you with us. For instance, app stores may provide reports to help us identify and resolve service issues.</li>
<li>Information Others Provide About You: We receive information about you from other users. For example, when other users you know use our Services, they may provide your phone number, name, and other information (like information from their mobile address book) just as you may provide theirs. They may also send you messages, send messages to groups to which you belong. We require each of these users to have lawful rights to collect, use, and share your information before providing any information to us.</li>
<li>You should keep in mind that in general, any user can capture screenshots of your chats or messages and send them to TranslateChat or anyone else, or post them on another platform.</li>
<li>User Reports: Just as you can report other users, other users or third parties may also choose to report to us your interactions and your messages with them or others on our Services; for example, to report possible violations of our Terms or policies. When a report is made, we collect information on both the reporting user and reported user.</li>
<li>Translation Feedback: Just as you can provide feedback on translations, other users may also choose to offer feedback on translations generated by our Services. This information may include your messages, as the user submitting the feedback may be one of your recipients.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Information We Collect Through Automated Means</h2>
<p>When you use our Services, we collect some information automatically. We and
our service providers (which are third party companies that work on our
behalf) may use various technologies, including cookies and similar
technologies, to help collect this information.</p>
<ul>
<li>Device Information and Related Identifiers: When you install, access, or use our Services, we and our service providers collect and analyze a wide range of information, such as your IP address, language, time zone, app version, browser characteristics, hardware model, battery level, device operations information, device IDs and characteristics, platform type, advertising identifier, operating system, and the state or country from which you accessed the Services. Additionally, we gather device connection-specific details like signal strength, mobile network, connection specifics (including phone number, mobile operator, or ISP).</li>
<li>Usage And Log Information: We collect information about your activity on our Services, like service-related, diagnostic, and performance information. This includes information about your activity (including how you use our Services, your Services settings, how you interact with others using our Services, and the time, frequency, and duration of your activities and interactions), log files, and diagnostic, crash, website, and performance logs and reports. This also includes information about when you registered to use our Services; the features you use like our messaging, groups (including group name, group picture, group description), payments or business features; profile photo, "about" information; whether you are online, when you last used our Services (your "last seen"); and when you last updated your "about" information.</li>
<li>Other Information: When you use our Services, we collect and store on our servers additional information, such as randomly generated authentication tokens and public encryption keys, push notification tokens, and other material necessary to transmit messages.</li>
<li>Location Information: When you use the Services, we and our service providers collect general location information from your device. "General" means information about the city, state, and country in which your device is located based on its IP address. We also use your location information for diagnostics and troubleshooting purposes.</li>
<li>Crash and Error Reports: When an error or crash occurs in your client application, information about the error or crash may be uploaded to our servers so that we can prevent similar issues from occurring in the future.</li>
<li>Cookies: We use cookies to operate and provide our Services, including to provide our Services that are web-based, improve your experiences, understand how our Services are being used, and customize them. For example, we use cookies to provide our Services for web and desktop and other web-based services. Additionally, we may use cookies to remember your choices, like your language preferences, to provide a safer experience, and otherwise to customize our Services for you.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Information You and We Share</h2>
<p>You share your information as you use and communicate through our Services,
and we share your information to help us operate, provide, improve,
understand, customize, support, and market our Services.</p>
<ul>
<li>Send Your Information To Those With Whom You Choose To Communicate: You share your information (including messages) as you use and communicate through our Services.</li>
<li>Information Associated With Your Account: Your phone number, profile name and photo, last seen information, and message receipts are available to anyone who uses our Services, although you can configure your profile and settings to manage certain information available to other users, including businesses, with whom you communicate.</li>
<li>Your Contacts And Others: Users, including businesses, with whom you communicate can store or reshare your information (including your phone number or messages) with others on and off our Services. You can use your Services settings and the "block" feature in our Services to manage who you communicate with on our Services and certain information you share.</li>
<li>Third Party Services: When you or others use third party services that are integrated with our Services, those third party services may receive information about what you or others share with them. For example, if you use a data backup service integrated with our Services (like iCloud or Google Drive), they will receive information you share with them, such as your TranslateChat messages. If you interact with a third party service linked through our Services, such as when you use the in-app player to play content from a third party platform, information about you, like your IP address and the fact that you are a TranslateChat user, may be provided to such a third party. Please note that when you use third party services, their own terms and privacy policies will govern your use of those services and products.</li>
</ul>
<h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>
<p>We use information we have (subject to choices you make and applicable law)
to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Provide, operate, manage, and improve our Services.</li>
<li>Administer your account, including to create it in the first place and to verify your information.</li>
<li>Completing purchases, verifying transactions, and managing subscriptions.</li>
<li>Respond to your requests for information and provide you with effective customer service.</li>

<li>We may use information we have to verify accounts and activity; combat harmful conduct; protect users against bad experiences and spam; and promote safety, security, and integrity on and off our Services, such as by investigating suspicious activity or violations of our Terms and policies, and to ensure our Services are being used legally. Please see the Law, Our Rights and Protection section below for more information.</li>
</ul>
<p>We may also aggregate, de-identify, or anonymize any information collected
through the Services so that we cannot reasonably link information to you or
your device. We may use such aggregate, de-identified, or anonymous
information for any purpose, including, without limitation, for research and
marketing purposes.</p>
<h2>Communications from TranslateChat</h2>
<p>We use information we have to communicate with you about our Services and let
you know about our terms, policies, and other important updates. We may
provide you marketing for our Services.</p>
<p>Sometimes we'll send administrative messages about account or Services changes
via text message or email, e.g. when you create or sign-in to your account. It
may not be possible to opt out of administrative messages.</p>
<p>You can opt out of most other types of messages, e.g. emails about new
TranslateChat features for example.</p>
<h2>Disclosure of Your Information</h2>
<p>We don't share your personal information outside the company, except:</p>
<ul>
<li>Service Providers: We work with third party service providers to help us operate, provide, improve, understand, customize, support, and market our Services. We may grant these third parties access to your information to assist us in functions such as sales, marketing, product content, features, analytics, research, customer service, delivery and other systems, data storage, security, spam and fraud prevention, legal services, providing technical infrastructure, and protecting the safety, security, and integrity of users and others. When we share information with third party service providers in this capacity, we require them to use your information on our behalf and contractually restrict them from using personal information for purposes other than providing services to us, in accordance with our instructions and terms, as well as for legal/compliance purposes.</li>
<li>To Protect TranslateChat and Others and for Legal Compliance: We may access, retain and disclose the information we collect and maintain about you if required to do so by law or in a good-faith belief that such access, retention, or disclosure is reasonably necessary to: (i) comply with law or legal process (e.g., a subpoena or court order); (ii) enforce our Terms of Service, this Privacy Policy, or other contracts with you, including investigation of potential violations of it; (iii) respond to your requests for customer service; or (iv) protect the rights, property or personal safety of TranslateChat, its agents and affiliates, its users, or the public. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection, spam and malware prevention, and similar purposes.</li>
<li>Business Transfers: We may become involved in mergers, acquisitions, restructurings, bankruptcies, sales of assets, or partnerships with other companies. In such transactions (including in the contemplation of such transactions) user information may be among the assets transferred. If a portion or all of our assets are sold or transferred to a third party, customer information (including your phone number or email address) would likely be one of the transferred business assets. We will share your information with the successor entities or new owners in connection with the transaction, in accordance with applicable data protection laws.</li>
<li>Your Consent: If you have consented to our sharing of your information, we will also share your information consistent with your consent.</li>
</ul>
<p>Under no circumstances will we sell your personal information.</p>
<p>If we will share your information in response to legal process, we will give
you notice so you can challenge it (for example by seeking court
intervention), unless we're prohibited from doing so by law or court order. We
will object to requests for information about users of our Services that we
believe to be improper.</p>
<p>If we merge with another company such that your information will become
subject to a different privacy policy, we'll notify you before the transfer.
You can opt out of the new policy by deleting your account during the notice
period.</p>
<h2>Data Storage</h2>
<p>TranslateChat uses third party vendors and hosting partners, such as Amazon
Web Services, for hardware, software, networking, storage, and related
technology we need to run TranslateChat.</p>
<h2>Managing And Retaining Your Information</h2>
<p>We store information for as long as necessary for the purposes identified in
this Privacy Policy, including to provide our Services or for other legitimate
purposes, such as complying with legal obligations, enforcing and preventing
violations of our Terms, or protecting or defending our rights, property, and
users. The storage periods are determined on a case-by-case basis that depends
on factors like the nature of the information, why it is collected and
processed, relevant legal or operational retention needs, and legal
obligations.</p>
<p>If you would like to further manage, change, limit, or delete your
information, you can do that through the following tools:</p>
<ul>
<li>Services Settings: You can change your Services settings to manage certain information available to other users. You can manage your contacts, groups, and broadcast lists, or use our "block" feature to manage the users with whom you communicate.</li>
<li>Changing Your Mobile Phone Number, Profile Name And Picture, And "About" Information: If you change your mobile phone number, you must update it using our in-app change number feature and transfer your account to your new mobile phone number. You can also change your profile name, public profile picture, and primary language at any time.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Deleting Your Account</h2>
<p>You can delete your account through the app. Go to the in-app settings screen
and choose "Delete Account" to delete your account. We cannot recover an
account for you after it is deleted.</p>
<p>When you delete your TranslateChat account, your undelivered messages are
deleted from our servers as well as any of your other information we no longer
need to operate and provide our Services. Deleting your account will, for
example, delete your account info and profile photo and delete your
TranslateChat message history. Be mindful that if you only delete
TranslateChat from your device without using our in-app delete my account
feature, your information will be stored with us for a longer period. Please
remember that when you delete your account, it does not affect your
information related to the groups you created or the information other users
have relating to you, such as their copy of the messages you sent them.</p>
<p>To protect information from accidental or malicious destruction, we may not be
able to immediately delete residual copies of your data.</p>
<h2>Privacy Rights</h2>
<p>Depending on where you live and the local laws (such as those in the European
Union, California, or Nevada), you may have certain rights regarding your
personal information.</p>
<p>If you would like to exercise your rights, please contact us at
contact@translatechat.app. You may need to verify your identity before we can
service your request. Note that you can make many changes to your account
easily through the app.</p>
<h2>California Residents</h2>
<h3>Additional Information</h3>
<p>If you are a California resident, California law requires us to provide you
with some other information about how we collect, use, and share your
"personal information" (as defined in the California Consumer Privacy Act
("CCPA")).</p>
<p>Throughout our Privacy Policy, we discuss the specific pieces of personal
information we collect from and about our users. Under the CCPA, we are also
required to provide you with the "categories" of personal information we
collect as defined by California law. Depending on the types of services you
use, the categories we collect are: identifiers (such as name and phone
number); internet or other network or device activity (such as browsing
history or app usage); user-generated content (user profile pictures and your
messages); and other information that identifies or can be reasonably
associated with you. Please see Information We May Collect above for more
information.</p>
<p>We use the above categories of information that we collect from you and
analytics partners to provide and manage the Services you request; to contact
you; to analyze the use of our Services; to market our Services to you; for
error reporting and to improve the product; to audit consumer interactions on
the Services; to protect the rights of the Services; for legal compliance; and
with your consent. For more detail about the purposes for which we use
information, please see How We Use Your Information above for more
information.</p>
<p>Depending on the circumstances, we may share any of the above categories of
information we collect with: business partners to provide you with services
that you request; service providers; other parties, including government
entities, when required by law or to protect our users and services; social
media services pursuant to that service and your settings; and with your
consent or in connection with a corporate transaction. In addition, we may
share device information and identifiers and internet or other network or
device activity with entities that provide content and functionality. See How
We Use Your Information and Disclosure of Your Information to learn more</p>
<h2>California Privacy Rights</h2>
<p>If you are a California resident, the CCPA allows you (or an authorized agent
acting on your behalf) to make certain requests related to your personal
information. The CCPA allows you to request us to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Inform you about the categories of personal information we collect or disclose about you; the categories of sources of such information; the business or commercial purpose for collecting your personal information; and the categories of third parties with whom we share/disclose personal information. Such information is also set forth in this Privacy Policy.</li>
<li>Provide access to or a copy of certain personal information we hold about you.</li>
<li>Delete certain personal information we have about you.</li>
<li>Provide you with information about the financial incentives that we offer to you, if any.</li>
</ul>
<p>The CCPA further provides you with the right not to be discriminated against
(as provided in applicable law) for exercising your rights. Certain
information may be exempt from such requests under California law. We will
take reasonable steps to verify your identity before responding to a request.
In doing so, we may request information from you so that we can match data you
provide with data we maintain. If you would like more information about your
legal rights under California law or would like to exercise any of them, or if
you are an authorized agent making a request on a user's behalf, please
contact us at contact@translatechat.app and include "CCPA Consumer Request" in
the subject.</p>
<p>The California "Shine the Light" law gives residents of California the right
in some cases to request information from us about the way we share certain
categories of personal information (as defined in the Shine the Light law)
with third parties for their direct marketing purposes. We do not share your
personal information with third parties for their own direct marketing
purposes.</p>
<h2>European Union Economic Area &amp; Brazilian Residents</h2>
<h3>Legal Bases for Use of Your Information</h3>
<p>Some countries require that companies only process your "Personal Data" (as
that term is defined in the applicable law like the EU General Data Protection
Regulation) if they have a "legal basis" (or justifiable need) for processing
your Personal Data. If those laws apply, our legal bases for processing
Personal Data are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>When your Personal Data is necessary to perform our obligations under a contract (or pending contract) with you. For example, we will process your Personal Data to comply with our Terms of Service to enter a contract with you, and to honor our commitments in any contracts that we have with you.</li>
<li>When your Personal Data is necessary for our legitimate interests or the legitimate interests of others. For example, we will process your Personal Data: to operate our business and our Services; identify and fix any issues with our Services; provide security for our Services; learn more about how our customers use the Services; perform internal analytics concerning the Services; improve the Services and users' experiences with the Services; provide you with information about new products that we think you may find interesting using the phone number or email address which you have provided; make and receive payments; comply with legal requirements and defend our legal rights; prevent fraud; and to know the customer to whom we are providing Services.</li>
<li>When use of your Personal Data is necessary for us to comply with our legal obligations.</li>
<li>When we have your consent. For example, where a country requires that we obtain your consent before we process certain data, we will seek your consent in accordance with those countries' requirements.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Privacy Rights</h2>
<p>If you are a citizen of the European Economic Area ("EEA"), the United
Kingdom, or Switzerland, you may request that we:</p>
<ul>
<li>Provide access to or a copy of certain information we hold about you.</li>
<li>Delete certain information that we are holding about you.</li>
<li>Prevent the processing of your information for direct-marketing purposes (including any direct marketing processing based on profiling).</li>
<li>Update or rectify information that is out of date or incorrect.</li>
<li>Oppose, cancel, or restrict the way that we process and disclose certain of your information.</li>
<li>Transfer your information to a third party provider of services.</li>
<li>Revoke your consent for the processing of your information.</li>
</ul>
<p>To make such a request, please contact us at contact@translatechat.app and
include "EU Data Subject Request" in the subject line.</p>
<h2>Data Transfers</h2>
<p>TranslateChat shares information globally, externally with our TranslateChat
affiliates and subsidiaries, trusted service providers, and trusted business
partners ("Trusted Third Parties"), and with those with whom you communicate
around the world, in accordance with this Privacy Policy. In providing
services to you, TranslateChat may subcontract the processing of your data to,
or otherwise share your data with Trusted Third Parties located in various
countries or territories, including the United States, or any other country or
territory globally where our Services are provided outside of where you live,
in accordance with applicable law. Your information may, for example, be
transferred or transmitted to, or stored and processed in these countries or
territories for the purposes as described in this Privacy Policy. Those
Trusted Third Parties may be engaged in, among other things, the provision of
Services to you, the processing of transactions, or the provision of support
services. Please note that the countries or territories to which your
information is transferred may have different privacy laws and protections
than those in your home country or territory. These transfers are necessary to
provide the global Services set forth in our Terms, and by providing us with
your information, you acknowledge any such transfer, storage, or use.</p>
<p>If applicable, you may make a complaint to the data protection authority in
the country where you are based. Or you may seek a remedy through local courts
if you believe your rights have been breached.</p>
<h2>Nevada Resident Privacy Rights</h2>
<p>Under Nevada law, certain Nevada consumers may opt out of the sale of
"personally identifiable information" (as such terms are defined by Nevada
law) to a person for that person to license or sell such information to
additional persons. We do not engage in such activity.</p>
<h2>Law, Our Rights, And Protection</h2>
<p>We access, preserve, and share your information described in this Privacy
Policy if we have a good-faith belief that it is necessary to: (a) respond
pursuant to applicable law or regulations, legal process, or government
requests; (b) enforce our Terms and any other applicable terms and policies,
including for investigations of potential violations; (c) detect, investigate,
prevent, or address fraud and other illegal activity or security, and
technical issues; or (d) protect the rights, property, and safety of our
users, TranslateChat, or others, including to prevent death or imminent bodily
harm.</p>
