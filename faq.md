    Are you End-to-end encrypted?
    </p>
    <p>
    We currently do not offer End-to-end encryption (E2EE). We recommend against using this chat app for highly sensitive information and topics. 
    We hope to one day be able to offer end-to-end encryption.

    Do you store my conversations on your servers?
    </p>
    <p>
        We do not store your conversations. We only store the messages that have not been read by the recipient. 
        Once the message is read by the recipient we delete it off our servers. All the messages are stored on your device.
    </p>
    <p class="font-semibold">
    Do you store my contacts on your servers?
    </p>
    <p>
        We only store the phone number of the contacts that you have initiated a conversation with.
        We do not bulk upload your contacts. 
        We try to limit the storing of the personal information on our servers. 
        We do this by leverage mapping the phone number to your address book on device.

        This functionality is simmilar to other chat applications in the market today.
