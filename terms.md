<h1>Terms of Service</h1>
<p>Last Updated: October 8, 2023.</p>
<p>TranslateChat is a messaging service designed to translate all the messages
you send. As a consequence, it currently does not employ end-to-end
encryption. Please be aware that your messages are shared with TranslateChat
and our Large Language Model ("LLM") provider to facilitate the translation
process.</p>
<p>These Terms of Service ("Terms") are a contract between you and TranslateChat,
governing your usage of TranslateChat's products, mobile apps, websites,
services, and content (collectively referred to as "Services").</p>
<p>By using TranslateChat, you agree to these Terms. If you don't agree to any of
the Terms, you can't use TranslateChat. Do not continue to use TranslateChat
if you do not agree to all of the Terms stated on this page.</p>
<p>We can change these Terms at any time. If a change is material, we'll let you
know before they take effect. By using TranslateChat on or after that
effective date, you agree to the new Terms. If you don't agree to them, you
should delete your account before they take effect, otherwise your use of the
Services will be subject to the new Terms.</p>
<h2>European Union</h2>
<p>TranslateChat ("TranslateChat," "our," "we," or "us") provides the services
described below to you ("Services") unless you live in a country or territory
in the European Economic Area (which includes the European Union) and any
other included country or territory (collectively referred to as the "European
Region").</p>
<h2>Account Registration</h2>
<p>To access our Services, you must register for a TranslateChat account by
providing a phone number.</p>
<h2>Content Rights &amp; Responsibilities</h2>
<p>You own the rights to the content you create and send using TranslateChat. You
must have the necessary rights to such information that you submit for your
TranslateChat account or send through our Services and the right to grant the
rights and licenses in our Terms. You're responsible for the content you send
or post. This means you assume all risks related to it.</p>
<p>To operate and provide our Services, you grant TranslateChat a worldwide, non-
exclusive, royalty-free, sublicensable, and transferable license to use,
reproduce, distribute, create derivative works of, display, and perform the
information (including the content) that you upload, submit, store, send, or
receive on or through TranslateChat's Service. You grant this right for the
limited purpose of operating and providing our Services (such as to allow us
to display a profile picture, transmit a message, and store your unencrypted
undelivered messages on our servers as we try to deliver them).</p>
<p>You can delete any of your content, or your account, at any time. To protect
information from accidental or malicious destruction, we may not be able to
immediately delete residual copies of your data.</p>
<p>Address Book. We take the security of your address book access seriously by
minimizing data transfer to our servers. After you grant us access, if a
contact isn't registered or lacks name/photo information, we use your address
book for local display on your device, ensuring this data never leaves your
device. When selecting a contact, only their phone number is sent to our
servers, securely stored in a cryptographically hashed form without any
identifying details, and strictly used to help you find friends on
TranslateChat, with utmost respect for your privacy and data security.</p>
<p>Fees And Taxes. You are responsible for all carrier data plans, Internet fees,
and other fees and taxes associated with your use of our Services.</p>
<h2>Our Content and Services</h2>
<p>We reserve all rights in TranslateChat's look and feel. Some parts of
TranslateChat are licensed under third-party open source licenses. We may also
make some of our own code available under open source licenses. As for other
parts of TranslateChat, you may not copy or adapt any portion of our code or
visual design elements (including logos) without express written permission
from TranslateChat unless otherwise permitted by law.</p>
<p>You may not do, or try to do, the following: (1) access or tamper with non-
public areas of the Services, our computer systems, or the systems of our
technical providers; (2) access or search the Services by any means other than
the currently available, published interfaces (e.g. mobile apps) that we
provide; (3) forge any HTTP request or posting, or in any way use the Services
to send altered, deceptive, or false source-identifying information; or (4)
interfere with, or disrupt, the access of any user, host, or network,
including sending malware, overloading, flooding, spamming, message-bombing
the Services, or by scripting the creation of content or accounts in such a
manner as to interfere with or create an undue burden on the Services.</p>
<p>You may not use our Services in any way, including uploading, posting,
sharing, or linking to any information, that is, abusive, unlawful,
fraudulent, harmful, tortious, defamatory, libelous, obscene, invasive of the
privacy of another person, threatening, harassing, abusive, hateful, racist,
infringing, pornographic, violent, or otherwise objectionable or inappropriate
as determined in TranslateChat's sole discretion.</p>
<p>Crawling the Services is allowed if done in accordance with the provisions of
our robots.txt file, but scraping the Services is prohibited.</p>
<p>We may change, terminate, or restrict access to any aspect of the service, at
any time, without notice. You agree that TranslateChat shall not be liable to
you or any third party for any modification, suspension or discontinuance of
the Services.</p>

Services and your mobile phone and a fixed-line telephone and SMS services.
Our Services do not provide access to emergency services or emergency services
providers, including the police, fire departments, or hospitals, or otherwise

your relevant emergency services providers through a mobile phone, a fixed-
line telephone, or other service.</p>

Services, which we otherwise do not supply. To use our Services, you consent

that occur through your TranslateChat account. It is your responsibility to
